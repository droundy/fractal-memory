Fractal Memory
==============

This is a memory game based on fractal flames.  It tests your ability
to remember and recognize images.  In order to provide a comparison,
we will also (soon) test your ability to remember and recognize words
and character sequences, in order to quantify the difficulty of
recognizing fractals.

To do:
-----

* Add networking to collect statistics regarding which fractals are
  misidentified.
* Add "flag" and similar.
* Add openssh's "random art".
* Add original "random art".
* Figure out how to query screen dpi, to size text and images
  consistently.
* Add buttons for nicer interface?
